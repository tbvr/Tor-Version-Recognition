4. study how to quantify difference in boxplot
5. sample some high acc website and see how its differ
6. summarize update changelog.txt / cve report
7. test if trainging dataset and testing dataset differs(different webpages for training dataset)
8. Test how many data is needed for such attack

### Done

- browser version classifier for each domain
- boxplot for selected domain
	- plot relatively low accuracy in version classifier
	- select top 9 common features appearing in top 10 important features of each version classifier
- add burst features(high accuracy rate for browser version classifier)
	- 87% for 90% training set, 10% testing set
	- 86% for 70% training set, 30% testing set(testing set may contain domain not formerly exists in training set)
	- 80% for 50% training set, 50% testing set
- Possible threat of version classifier
- Working on a [prototype of the paper](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16AaWo7sf-HSeb1UPM9CfhTf2avqYOHwigxEQITrANFM/edit?usp=sharing)
- fetch js from the selected domain

### Todo

- Check if there is any file loaded to website which can affect traffic features(ex: css,json,....)
- analyze javascript loaded from selected website
- finish prototype of the paper
- record changelog or cve of tor browser
- test amount of required data for version classifier(?)
- how to quantify difference between boxplot

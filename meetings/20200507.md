## Done

- Feature Extraction
- study Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow (ongoing)
- WF attack model scan through
	- typical ML: 100 traces for each sites
	- DL(CNN): 1000 traces for each sites
	- classification
		- monitored / un-monitored webpages
		- specific webpages

## todo

- Keep studying the resources, try clustering & classification
- Create datasets of different tbb version(tbb 8, tbb 7 and etc) with more instance, try virtual network interface
- Integration of crawler and pcapParser(due to limited storage on ec2)

## Dataset

crawling info:
- tor browser bundle 9.0.2

[weblist(top 200 url on Tranco WebList)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjmSOgE420mlN0Jh375Snf0a6YR5wRlg?usp=sharing)

contains both raw traffic(all hte header of the traffic) and extracted features
There are 150-170 traffic for each websites. The Weblist are top 200 weblist on Tranco WebList.

```
traffic/
contains the raw traffic in csv form(record every header of the traffic).


TrafficResult.tar.gz 
contains the extracted features.
```

Overhead analysis, packet examination.

## Research questions

1. Can a attack model trained on a dataset collected with a specific tbb version works well on another tbb version?
2. Is it possible to figure out category of the website through clustering
	- Different website may have different purpose, and this may have an impact on the traffic(ex: news page(lots of img) v.s. Simple blogs(lots of words, few img))
3. Is it possible to train a model with few amount of data(online learning, batch learning?)
4. Can we train on partial of the traffic and conduct classification given only partial of traffic?
5. Is there any sign to tell when the pages finish loading? (useful in seperating traffic of sequential visit)

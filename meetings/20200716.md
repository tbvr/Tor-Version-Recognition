## Done

- Add some features(burst/timestamp/3rd quratile interval time)
- download tor changelog and scanned through the update
- Study statistic,information theory
- construct a random forest based browser classifier and record crucial features

## Todo

- Deeper inspection into the features(select severl webpages, see how these features are distributed among browser version)
- refer to [infoleak](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xT9s839xjn7UYomQn9ACRMfrTnpcChx0/view?usp=sharing) Try to combine features with high shared information, and examine entropy loss of each features.
- any metric other than entropy loss?

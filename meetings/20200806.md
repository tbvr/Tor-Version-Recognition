## recap(last meeting)

- Try to figure out why attack model can't work if the browser version differs
- construct browser classifier
	- around 80% accuracy rate
	- retrieve several important features for further analysis

### Approach

- browser Classifier to test the feasibility of classifying traffic to a specific browser version
- single out several websites, analyze features from these websites
- Covariance matrix to inspect dependency between features
- PCA analysis implies the relation between amount of features and accuracy

## Done

### domain and torbrowser version accuracy evaluation

- train a huge browser version classifier or train version classifiers for every single domain?
- [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMylOaFT_ng3tNbcK9g-HTLeRTgDZ67d6Bfpe-M1ZMo/edit?usp=sharing)
- giphy.com seems to do a great job in WF defense
- retrieve features which importance rate > 1%
- only evalute avg_outgoing_packetOrder so far(some features are not obvious)

### [Feature Covariance, Correlation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11MmmJIwuWhUPy-3R7fRDfp_AeCNfGoPx?usp=sharing)

- top 30(which has feature importance over 1%, based on browserClassifier)
- amount of data: 120441

## Todo

- Inspect deeper to the results from the experiments
	- analyze WF features difference between browser version for certain webpages
	- Covraiance,correlation matrix together with PCA analysis may tell us information about features

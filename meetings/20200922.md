## Done

- Reproduce results in 2 researches
	- SVM
		- The method used to prove difference in tor browser version lead to low accuracy in the research ccs 2014
		- **Target: prove the statement still hold in recent tor browser version**
		- 40 instances for top 100 sites
		- kernel: Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
		- Difficulties: lack of intact source code, Implementation of svm kernel(precoumpted, not feasible)
	- Deep Fingerprint(DF)
		- Most powerful Website Fingerprint attack(accuracy rate of 98.3% in closed world assumption) and high accuracy rate even if defense method applied
		- SDAE + CNN
		- Target: Compare our method(version classifier + WF classifier) is better than DF regarding traffic multiple browser version
		- Difficulties: around 200 instances for each websites. It doesn't seems to be feasible with these amount of data, callback somehow doesn't works...

## Todo

- finish reproducing research
	- prove Browser version still affect website traffic with svm model
	- compare our model with the most powerful one(DeepFingerprint, as far as I know) and prove ours can work cross browser version 
- integrate version classifier with WF classifier model
- Study quantify methods
	- mann Whitney test
	- Anova
	- two sample mean test
- help with javascript requests/response analysis

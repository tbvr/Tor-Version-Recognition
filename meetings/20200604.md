## Done

- [study Measuring Information Leakage in Website Fingerprinting A acks and Defenses(ccs 2018)](https://hackmd.io/@NCGXxkNfR2WNISqcwagt4Q/SJCtXh5jI)
- wavelet transform features
- gradient boosting testing
- Deal with multiple crawler execution
	- network interface issue
	- cron job settings

## Todo

- study information theory
- study statistics / basic ML

## Feature analysis with Information theory

### Basic Concept

I(F,W) = H(W) - H(W|F)
NMI = I(r,c)/max(H(r),H(c))

I: information gained(information leak)
H: entropy
W: Website information
F: random variable
NMI(r,c):描述兩個features r,c的dependency

### Thoughts

- Evaluate information leaks of the tbb version(9,8,7) give an explanation on the classification results
	- EX: Does the most important feature has the highest entropy, leading to a large amount of information leakage
- Evaluate if the important features remain the same if we crawl the data few weeks later
- Clustering, correlate the traffic features with the Webpage pattern
	- EX: cluster webpage into groups, each group has some kinds of similar traffic features
	- Inspect if this webpage share similar webpage pattern?
	- Calculate which groups of webpage has the highest information leaks, which may lead to conclusion that websites with certain traffic features is vulnerable to WF attack

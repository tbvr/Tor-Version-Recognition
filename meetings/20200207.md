## Done

- Survey how other crawl data(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NdSn-r8jD3IBJuMOa-gZtWm0ftHVDLXl)
- Objective: An evaluation on the feasibility of WF ML/DL attack(AWF/DF/k-fingerprint)
- Sample Dataset
	- [ccs2014 evaluation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mu9EfQUJCAFWsrAvcqo6_MHmgMib8GFD)

## Objective

Focus on the A Critical Evaluation of Website Fingerprinting Attacks(CCS 2014)
- Predict the correct websites given only part of the network traffic
- content-based analysis: not all the websites change content so much(maybe only part of them), so the attack model could still be effective to those webpage
	- packet changes
	- snapshot
	- amount of requests/responses and respective packet length represent web content change rate => examine relationship with accuracy
- Categorizing(two step prediction attack)
	- cluster analysis on traffic of websites
	- inspect its long term change rate

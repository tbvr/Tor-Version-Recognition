## Done

- Organize all my works

- WebsiteList
	- Crawled from Alexa and sampled some categories
	- 50 top sites for each categories
	- [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yLjNNHlwJnBUU7vo5Z4kGGVHkiG2TfkR)

- crawler implementation
	- tor browser
	- tbselenium
	- tcpdump(subprocess)

- pcap parser(filtering ack)
	- feature data list
	- [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_UDeRyxo8ZPlt6sjFihTSskHfzrfAxZa)

- partially analyze the packet features
	- [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tcwZ31TJD25HR8qCcM85AJI019dDosD89diu_vgBYNc/edit?usp=sharing)

## issues

- Some websites are not crawlable
	- ic3.gov
	- ncjrs.gov
	- ErrorList.txt
- Insufficient storage in VM


## Difficulties

- tbselenium cannot run without a gui display(frame)
	- Could probably be solved with xvfb


## Todo
1. Data collection revision(noise/tainted data removal), vm memory expasion
2. Data mining: try to clarify if different categories of websites have different WF features and can be easily classified(Category level classification)
3. Visualize the DF feature changes if web content changed(Feature extraction of same website for several days)
4. DF implementation(Try to visualize the relationship among training time, accuracy, web content change rates)
5. Study paper: A Critical Evaluation of Website Fingerprinting Attacks(2014)

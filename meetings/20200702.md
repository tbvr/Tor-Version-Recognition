	- After removed some failed visits, remaining traffic instances for each sitesrange from 120 to 230
	- screenshot of all websites for torbrowser 7,8,9
	- Rules for traffic instance removal
		1. If the median of number of packets in the websites are less than 100, we remove the website
		2. If the traffic instance has number of packets less than **median * 0.8**, remove the traffic instances
- Study information theory
	- Study the concept of entropy, how it can be utilized in WF information measurement
	- [ppt](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK_YZ2rV8j4J_sTv3hgr2Cjklszna6TY5T6m_5KUeQQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- Taget:
	- Evaluate the results of testing WF attack among various of tor browser verseion
	- Inspect the reason of the results
	- Come up with a basic idea/method to evaluate/measure the information leaks of tor browser version regarding Website fingerprint

## Todo

- Summarize / lists all the update from tbb version 7 to version 9
- think of pros and cons for the basic information measurement
- keep studying information theory, figure out a better way for information measurement in our case
- Working on Feature Extraction
	- As proven in the [data processing inequality](https://youtu.be/YH7bXbiPgZI), data processing decrease the amount of information
- README update

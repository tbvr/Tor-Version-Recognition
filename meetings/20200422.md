## Issue in Data collection

People seems to collect data in somehow different ways
There will always be noise

A webpage may contain several streams for data delivery
There will be multiple circuits in used for all the streams.
Collected data will contains packet from different circuits(noise).
For some circuits, hard to notice if they contain data for the webpage or for circuit construction

## Todo

1. Complete Feature Extraction code
2. Execute all the enviornment for data collection
3. train on tbb 902 and test the attacks on different tbb version
4. More vm, crawling around 250 websites(4 instance each) takes 6h or above

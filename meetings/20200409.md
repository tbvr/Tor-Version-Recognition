## Done

1. filter useless packet( ACK, SYN, FIN), extract header information of packet in pcap file
2. setup multiple server with different tor browser / tor proxy setting
	- tbb 9.0.2, tor proxy 4.0.1
	- tbb 9.0.2 tor proxy 3
3. documentation of methodology, setup
4. Summarize possible features

```
| tbb 9.0.2 + tor 4 | tbb 9.0.2 + tor 3 | firefox + tor 4 |
```

## issues

1. Tor guard node extraction

Tor proxy maintain a set of tor guard node / circuit, browser will select one for connection.
We can hardly know which one tor browser select(didn't find API for that)

solutions:
1. pcap inspection: for the non-chosen guard node, there will only have less than 10 packets in the pcap file(probably just kind of pinging)
	- frequency of each IP in pcap file
2. Try if we can fixed selected guard node when visited
3. Find API for retrieving selected guard node in tor browser

## Todo

0. Solve the tor guard node issue
1. Finish Feature Extraction & Do some analysis
2. Run the crawler with different setting(tbb,firefox,tor proxy) at the same time for evaluation
3. Study sklearn, ML techniques
